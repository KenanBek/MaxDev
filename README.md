## Get Started

Download the latest version of maxDEV for your platform from the [Releases](https://github.com/KenanBek/maxDEV/releases) or from the [Download Page](https://kenanbek.github.io/maxDEV/download.html) with autotomatic platform detection.

The application is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### Updates

Currently, we use an **aggressive** update strategy. This means that the application checks for updates every time it is launched. If an update is available, it is downloaded and installed automatically.

With more stable releases, we will switch to a **background** update strategy. This means that the application will check for updates in the background and notify the user when an update is available. The user can then choose to install the update or ignore it.
